\section{Concurrency in C}
The C parallel programming paradigm follows directly from its design philosophy: low level and unsafe, in the sense that the programmer is trusted to write safe code. Because C does not check pointer operations, C programs can cause notorious problems such as use-after-free bugs. Common pitfalls such as data races and deadlock can easily go unnoticed and must be avoided by adhering to “good practice” conventions. The hazards posed by concurrent programming in C are easy to run into and potentially limit the scalability of concurrent software written in C. This manifests strikingly in most modern browsers which are struggling to benefit from multiprocessor devices as their core rendering engines are written as single-threaded C++ monoliths~\cite{servo}.
