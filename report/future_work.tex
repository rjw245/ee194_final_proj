\section{Future Work}\label{sec::futurework}

While this work illustrates many of the challenges associated with using the Rust language, as well as its powerful safety features, it also raises many future research questions. For example, a comprehensive comparison of safe C style languages such as Rust, Ivory, and Go would likely benefit the concurrency community. Also, our results show that Rust's locking scheme could benefit from optimization in the case that a lock is acquired and a result is calculated in the same line. Further, while the benchmarks used in this work uncovered critical aspects of Rust programming, analyzing benchmarks with irregular parallelism on larger data sets would be intriguing. In particular, following the work in~\cite{learning}, an analysis of Rustâ€™s use in a large scale project such as Servo to eliminate common concurrency pitfalls would demonstrate its long-term value well.
