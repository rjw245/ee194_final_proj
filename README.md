As a control, we will implement a single-threaded version of each benchmark so that we can have a baseline comparison of the two languages. Then from there we will compare the performance of the two languages on a multi-threaded implementation of the same benchmarks. Any new differences that arise can be attributed with confidence to the way each language implements concurrency.
