/*****************************************************************************
 * FILE: mpithreads_threads.c
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *   This simple program illustrates the use of Pthreads in a program obtained
 *   by modifying a serial code that performs a dot product. It is the second
 *   of four codes used to show the progression from a serial program to a
 *   hybrid MPI/Pthreads program.  The other relevant codes are:
 *      - mpithreads_serial.c   - The serial version
 *      - mpithreads_mpi.c - A distributed memory programming model with MPI
 *      - mpithreads_both.c - A hybrid model that utilizes both MPI and
 *          Pthreads to execute on systems that are comprised of clusters
 *          of SMP's.
 *   The main data is made available to all threads through a globally 
 *   accessible structure. Each thread works on a different part of the 
 *   data.  The main thread waits for all the threads to complete their 
 *   computations, and then it prints the resulting sum.
